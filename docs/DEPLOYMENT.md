# Deployment Documentation

This document outlines the deployment process for the UI Design Agent project. It includes the necessary steps, configurations, and considerations to ensure a smooth deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

- The application is built and tested successfully.
- Environment variables are configured correctly in the `.env` file.
- Access to the deployment environment (e.g., cloud provider, server).

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the Application**
   - Run the build command to compile the application.
   - Example: `npm run build`

2. **Run Pre-Deployment Checks**
   - Execute any pre-deployment checks defined in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.
   - Ensure that all checks pass before proceeding.

3. **Deploy to the Server**
   - Use the deployment script or tool specified in the workflow.
   - Example: If using Docker, run `docker-compose up -d` to start the application.

4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Verify that the application is running correctly in the deployment environment.
   - Check logs for any errors or warnings.
   - Perform smoke tests to ensure key functionalities are working.

5. **Rollback Plan**
   - In case of deployment failure, have a rollback plan in place.
   - Ensure that previous versions of the application can be restored quickly.

## Continuous Deployment

This project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous deployment. The deployment workflow is triggered on specific events, such as merging to the main branch. Ensure that the workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) is configured correctly to automate the deployment process.

## Troubleshooting

- If deployment fails, check the logs for error messages.
- Ensure that all environment variables are set correctly.
- Verify that the server has sufficient resources to run the application.

## Conclusion

Following this deployment guide will help ensure a successful deployment of the UI Design Agent project. Always keep the documentation updated with any changes to the deployment process or configurations.
