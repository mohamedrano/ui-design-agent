# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The architecture of the UI Design Agent project is designed to facilitate the development of a robust and scalable web application. This document outlines the key components, their interactions, and the overall structure of the application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several main directories:

- **app/**: Contains the main application code, including pages, components, and API routes.
- **src/**: Contains the core libraries, utilities, and components used throughout the application.
- **public/**: Contains static assets such as fonts, images, and examples.
- **tests/**: Contains various types of tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation files, including API documentation, architecture, deployment guides, and design guidelines.

## Key Components

### 1. Application Layer

The `app/` directory is the heart of the application, containing:

- **Pages**: Each page is represented as a React component, with dynamic routing for project-specific pages.
- **API Routes**: The `api/` subdirectory contains various API endpoints for functionalities such as AI analysis, performance checks, and accessibility audits.

### 2. Source Layer

The `src/` directory includes:

- **Libraries**: Core libraries for AI functionalities, including flows and tools for analyzing and generating design assets.
- **Components**: Reusable UI components organized by features, promoting modularity and reusability.
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for managing state and side effects.

### 3. Static Assets

The `public/` directory serves static files that are directly accessible by the client, including fonts and images.

### 4. Testing

The `tests/` directory is structured to support various testing strategies, ensuring code quality and reliability through unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow is supported by CI/CD pipelines defined in the `.github/workflows/` directory:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The `ci.yml` file defines the steps for building, linting, type-checking, and testing the application, ensuring code quality and adherence to performance budgets.
- **Deployment**: The `deploy.yml` file outlines the automated deployment process, including pre-deployment checks to ensure stability.

## Conclusion

This architecture is designed to support the ongoing development and maintenance of the UI Design Agent project, providing a clear structure for collaboration and scalability. Future enhancements can be easily integrated into this framework, ensuring the application remains adaptable to changing requirements.
