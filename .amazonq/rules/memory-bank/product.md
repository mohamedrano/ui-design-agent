# UI Design Agent - Product Overview

## Project Purpose
Advanced AI-powered UI design analysis and redesign intelligence agent that provides comprehensive design system analysis, accessibility auditing, performance optimization, and automated component generation.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Multi-source Analysis**: Reads CSS/SCSS/LESS, HTML/JSX/TSX, README/Docs, and design tokens to extract complete design language
- **WCAG 2.2 Compliance**: Automated accessibility auditing with constraint solver for precise fixes
- **Production-Ready Generation**: Creates design systems, Tailwind configs, CSS variables, and multi-theme support
- **Intelligent Refactoring**: Converts scattered CSS to Tailwind utilities with automatic purging and complexity reduction
- **Component Library Generation**: Produces React/TS components using shadcn/ui + Radix UI patterns
- **Performance Budgets**: Lighthouse/Axe/Playwright integration with CI gates and actionable reports
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Multi-viewport screenshot comparison with PR integration
- **A/B Testing & Impact Measurement**: Objective UI quality evaluation with usability metrics

## Key Features

### Analysis & Intelligence
- Design language extraction (colors, fonts, spacing, grids, patterns)
- RAG-powered searchable knowledge base
- Comprehensive CSS/HTML/component analysis
- Performance and accessibility auditing

### Generation & Automation
- Design system token generation (Style Dictionary)
- Tailwind configuration generation
- React component library creation
- Storybook stories generation
- CSS-to-Tailwind conversion

### Quality Assurance
- WCAG 2.2 compliance checking
- Visual diff detection across viewports
- Performance budget enforcement
- Bundle size optimization
- Code quality metrics

### Integration & Workflow
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Vercel deployment automation
- OpenTelemetry observability
- Sentry error tracking

## Target Users
- **Frontend Developers**: Seeking automated design system generation and CSS optimization
- **Design System Teams**: Building and maintaining consistent design languages
- **QA Engineers**: Implementing accessibility and performance testing
- **Product Teams**: Measuring UI quality impact and A/B testing results
- **DevOps Teams**: Integrating design quality gates into CI/CD pipelines

## Use Cases
1. **Legacy CSS Modernization**: Convert existing CSS codebases to modern Tailwind utilities
2. **Design System Creation**: Generate comprehensive design systems from existing components
3. **Accessibility Compliance**: Automated WCAG auditing with actionable fix suggestions
4. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size analysis and optimization recommendations
5. **Visual Regression Prevention**: Automated screenshot comparison across deployments
6. **Component Library Generation**: Create production-ready React component libraries
7. **Multi-theme Support**: Generate light/dark/high-contrast theme variations
8. **CI/CD Quality Gates**: Integrate design quality checks into deployment pipelines
